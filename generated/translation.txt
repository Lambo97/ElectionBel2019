A nail bomb, a few grenade attacks in one week, shootings with Kalashnikovs, arson... The drug war is raging in and around Antwerp. Mayor Bart De Wever has lost control and is detecting NERGENS.

And if it's up to Bart De Wever, NOG will soon pay a little more...§We pay almost the highest taxes in Europe and get the lowest pensions instead. Now introduce a minimum pension of €1500 for those who have worked hard all their lives. This is not left or right, but a matter of RIGHTNESS!§It's incomprehensible. Jan Jambon completely ignores the crushing political responsibility of Minister of Justice Koen Geens over impunity. If that wasn't bad enough, Jambon uses the same tricks of the left to spit out part of the population as "racists". Who still believes that man?  Who still believes those socialists? The population doesn't want new taxes. Save on immigration, money transfers to Wallonia and the political system. That helps our people out of need!   (Source: The Seventh Day)§This is unacceptable.

What a wrong signal from the board of GO! education! § Help us with the election campaign & adjust your profile picture! #FirstOur people§"That feeling of impunity, which unfortunately is not only a feeling but also a fact, is a stain on our democracy. After all, security is a basic right." - Tom Van Grieken§"Vlaams Belang shares the great concern of the Flemish people and points out that mass immigration is not an inevitability that we have to endure as a kind of natural disaster. The tide can indeed be turned. That is the stakes of 26 May." - Tom Van Grieken§Is Green completely insane? We're not going to allow us to pay our blue taxes and especially not allow us to have to declare our bookshelves. This kind of scandalous pseudo-communist proposals belong directly in the trash! §nan§We demand the resignation of Minister Koen Geens!

This country deserves better!  ▶️Teken therefore the petition: www.ontslaggeens.be§8 years for a serial rapist. 8 years for someone who has traumatized at least 19 women for life. And then some politicians wonder why the population has lost faith in justice. It's time to punish sex crimes HARD, it's time to make justice back RIGHT! §Safety is a Basic RIGHT. It is time to restore credibility to justice and end impunity. We are always going to let criminals serve their sentences to the full! @vangriekentom #FirstOur people§It's not left or right to demand REAL justice. It's not left or right to attack and rape HARD. This should be a top priority for everyone, because no victim should be abandoned by a failing justice and an incompetent minister. Time for real change!  (Feel free to agree)§What has Koen Geens actually done in the past 5 years? Faith in justice has reached an absolute low. Serious crimes of morality still get low punishments. Prisoners are radicalizing a lot in our prisons. Stop this mismanagement, stop impunity and no new term for this minister of broken promises!§Stop impunity! LIKE if you agree.§We pay GIGANTIC taxes on petrol (price currently highest level since 2015), energy poverty has never been so high, purchasing power is falling,....

STOP the plague taxes and EXCEPTION of the population!§You too?§It's going from bad to worse in Brussels-North. Diseases, nuisance, thefts, harassment of commuters... Today even a RTL camera crew was attacked. Our solution: actively detect illegal immigrants, pick them up and lock them up, evict them and control the borders. It is time to CLEAN this country, because ILLEGALITY = CRIMINALITY!§All other parties are silent about the FIRST Islamic school in Flanders (in Genk) of the radical Islamic Turkish movement Milli Görüs. UNACCEPTABLE. Stop Islamic schools in our country!§Karel De Gucht (Open VLD) once called our voters dung beetles. Karel De Gucht (Open VLD) was today convicted of evading taxes.§ It is one year since Theo Francken, Jan Jambon and Didier Reynders went to Marrakech to sign the so-called 'Declaration of Marrakech' on behalf of the Belgian government. This text advocates "encouraging and strengthening the paths to regular migration". At that time Francken also quietly cooperated with the UN Migration Pact, also known as the Marrakech Pact. The N-VA's tough talk and election pledges are in stark contrast to the lax policy Francken actually pursued. In barely four years time, 500,000 new foreigners entered the country.

It's about protecting our borders, our social security, freedom of the press, our population... The Marrakech Pact MUST be a BREEKPUNT!§ Isn't it clear to everyone by now?

Spread these images so that this ASOCIAL behaviour will not be covered up! §Merksem (Bouckenborghpark), 27 April. These riots with "young people" are silenced by the media. This criminal behaviour does NOT belong in our society. Spread these images, because this should not be covered up!§Stop mass importing violence and backwardness.

IMMIGRATIONSTOP NOW!§Large election meeting in Ninove!§According to a survey, 6 out of 10 Flemish people still have doubts about who they will give their vote to. So, we still have 4 weeks to campaign hard and convince people. On to victory. On to May 26th! #FirstOur people #Flemish-HANDY! Whoever commits such crimes (this time in Erpe-Mere) is never allowed to roam freely in our streets. Is it any wonder then that the population feels impunity? Is it bizarre that the public loses confidence in the government and justice? Time for real change! "All those asylum seekers are going to pay our pensions", doesn't NOT believe that? Stop lying to the people. Mass immigration is NOT an enrichment for our society! Did you know that Open Vld has been in the federal government for 20 years? This anti-social liberal party raised taxes on energy and fuel, increased the retirement age by two years and opened the immigration gates wide. Stop squeezing out the population and saddling them with an immigration bill that NIEMAND asked for! §"Even under Theo Francken, our country remained a top destination for OCMW tourists from all over the world. A stricter immigration policy is necessary and possible" - Dries Van Langenhove§What a KIEZERSBEDROG. First pretending, but after the elections Jinnih Beels adored the seat. Can anyone count Bart De Wever's number of bends? One thing is becoming more and more clear: a vote for N-VA, is a vote for sp.a!§What a flip-flop for the posts! A vote for the N-VA is - just like in Antwerp and many other municipalities - a vote for the left. Time to give a strong signal and punish these games on May 26th! §This was the Family Day in Bokrijk. Our 3,000 participants show that we have started a movement. On the 26th of May we are going for a Flanders in which our people come first again!§ONAVAILABLE! A total of € 749 million was spent on these living wages under Jan Jambon and Charles MICHEL. Was this the power of change? STOP with our social security, STOP with the OCMW of playing all over the world!§In recent years, the so-called 'equal opportunities centre' Unia MILJOENEN received euros in subsidies from tough talkers Liesbeth Homans and Zuhal Demir (competent minister/ state secretary). Our position is crystal clear: turn on the subsidy tap, wipe up Unia and invest this money in OUR people!§Unbelievable! One year for such a horrible crime in Wevelgem, but according to competent minister Koen Geens nothing is wrong. Justice MUST be reformed. HARD sentences for crimes of morality, because justice must become just again!§Animal welfare is important to us. One of our points of view is to track down and tackle illegal animal trafficking via the internet.

This hypocritical measure is a flat tax, because for € 345 per year we can continue to "pollute" with our older diesel. In the LEZ of Bart De Wever in Antwerp this even amounts to € 360 per year. Who is ultimately the victim of this? The ordinary citizen who cannot afford a new car. STOP the LEZ in our country!§STOP the LEZ in our country!

And we all know what disastrous consequences this has had on our country. STOP mass immigration!§ Incredible! FREE courses are offered by Minister Homans to foreigners with great pleasure. And how much does one course cost in reality? €4,300 per person.
