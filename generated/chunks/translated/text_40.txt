100 asylum seekers on 1056 inhabitants in Messines. Hallucinatory. STOP new asylum centres in West Flanders! LIKE if you agree.§Who raised taxes on energy and fuel? Who raised the retirement age by two years? Who opened the immigration gates? Open Vld. And now they want to join a government without a Flemish majority. As long as they get the POSTJES. STOP this anti-social liberal party!§WAANZIN. Paul Magnette's latest memorandum proposes a new wave of regularisation of ILLEGALS. Is this what Flanders voted for? Is this listening to the population, Gwendolyn Rutten? A nail bomb, a few grenade attacks in one week, shootings with Kalashnikovs, arson... The drug war is raging in and around Antwerp. Mayor Bart De Wever has lost control and is detecting NERGENS. The local residents are out in the cold and it's only a matter of time before innocent victims are killed. Only a HARD approach can work! § During the warmest week Flanders shows its best side. This widely supported and heartwarming solidarity is part of our Flemish identity. We are happy to contribute to this with this action. We donate the entire proceeds to a good cause.

NIEMAND takes his responsibility and the minister even looks away. CD&V, Green and PVDA do not even bother to condemn this violence. What a shame! From 1 January, more than 600,000 registered cars can only enter an LEZ with a fine or an extra tax. Those who want to enter the city centre in 2027, will only be able to do so with the latest model diesel engine. An anti-social PESTBELASTING that is being introduced in more and more municipalities. The bill is for the ordinary citizen. STOP the asocial LEZs!§Stop those constant attacks on the motorist. They pay enough already. We continue to oppose the mileage charge, but also HYPOCRIETE and ASOCIAL measures such as the LEZ. After all, this is nothing more and nothing less than a hidden plague tax! § While the housing bonus of the hardworking Fleming is taken away, the same taxpayer continues to pay millions of euros for the maintenance and renovation of royal domains. Who can still justify this? §HALLUCINANT! In the first quarter of 2020, Maggie De Block requests €87 million EXTRA for asylum reception. The budget derails, but apparently more and more money can be "freed up" for asylum. Once again millions of taxpayers' money is being wasted, while OUR people are being left in the lurch. The progressive mayors Mohamed Ridouani and Mathias De Clercq VERBIEDEN Zwarte Piet in Leuven and Ghent. Stop ruining our children's party!§Matteo Salvini is coming to Flanders! Be there and register via the reference below.§Matteo Salvini is coming to Flanders!  "Someone like Salvini showed that parties like ours do make a difference. In the short period that he was in charge in Italy, he managed to reduce immigration and crime in his country. That's what we want for Flanders." - Tom Van Grieken Do you want to be there? That's possible! Registration is required via www.salvini.be§How many times do we have to have this discussion? STOP with ruining this children's party. Black Pete is black and St. Nicholas has a mitre! §Who's polarizing? Surely those are the ones who WITHOUT INSPECTION from the locals are planting asylum centres all over the place? STOP with that and listen to the will of the people!§This Saturday our members were re-elected @vangriekentom as chairman of our party. Putting our people first! That remains our priority. Take a look at the atmospheric report of the chairman's congress.§adapt your policy, Maggie De Block, and CONSULT with the people before you start planning asylum centres at random. We will continue the democratic resistance against the MIGRATION INVASION. Adapt your policy, Maggie De Block, and CONSULT with the population before you start planning asylum centers at random. We will continue the democratic resistance against the MIGRATION INVASION. Always and everywhere, with arguments and always peaceful!§"This vote is yet another missed opportunity. If N-VA and PVDA would be straightforward and act according to their words, they could, together with Vlaams Belang, have prevented this scandalous political appointment".
