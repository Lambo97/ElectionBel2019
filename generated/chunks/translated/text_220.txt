It's incomprehensible. Jan Jambon completely ignores the crushing political responsibility of Minister of Justice Koen Geens over impunity. If that wasn't bad enough, Jambon uses the same tricks of the left to spit out part of the population as "racists". Who still believes that man?  Who still believes those socialists? The population doesn't want new taxes. Save on immigration, money transfers to Wallonia and the political system. That helps our people out of need!   (Source: The Seventh Day)§This is unacceptable. Why should our youth have to move to a worse location in favour of an OKAN school? What a wrong signal from the board of GO! education! § Help us with the election campaign & adjust your profile picture! #FirstOur people§"That feeling of impunity, which unfortunately is not only a feeling but also a fact, is a stain on our democracy. After all, security is a basic right." - Tom Van Grieken§"Vlaams Belang shares the great concern of the Flemish people and points out that mass immigration is not an inevitability that we have to endure as a kind of natural disaster. The tide can indeed be turned. That is the stakes of 26 May." - Tom Van Grieken§Is Green completely insane? We're not going to allow us to pay our blue taxes and especially not allow us to have to declare our bookshelves. This kind of scandalous pseudo-communist proposals belong directly in the trash! §nan§We demand the resignation of Minister Koen Geens! Put some pressure on him, because his indifference and waving off political responsibility are a pure disgrace. This country deserves better!  ▶️Teken therefore the petition: www.ontslaggeens.be§8 years for a serial rapist. 8 years for someone who has traumatized at least 19 women for life. And then some politicians wonder why the population has lost faith in justice. It's time to punish sex crimes HARD, it's time to make justice back RIGHT! §Safety is a Basic RIGHT. It is time to restore credibility to justice and end impunity. We are always going to let criminals serve their sentences to the full! @vangriekentom #FirstOur people§It's not left or right to demand REAL justice. It's not left or right to attack and rape HARD. This should be a top priority for everyone, because no victim should be abandoned by a failing justice and an incompetent minister. Time for real change!  (Feel free to agree)§What has Koen Geens actually done in the past 5 years? Faith in justice has reached an absolute low. Serious crimes of morality still get low punishments. Prisoners are radicalizing a lot in our prisons. Stop this mismanagement, stop impunity and no new term for this minister of broken promises!§Stop impunity! LIKE if you agree.§We pay GIGANTIC taxes on petrol (price currently highest level since 2015), energy poverty has never been so high, purchasing power is falling,.... The taxes on diesel have even been increased sixteen times between 2015 and 2018. Aren't they ashamed? STOP the plague taxes and EXCEPTION of the population!§You too?§It's going from bad to worse in Brussels-North. Diseases, nuisance, thefts, harassment of commuters... Today even a RTL camera crew was attacked. Our solution: actively detect illegal immigrants, pick them up and lock them up, evict them and control the borders. It is time to CLEAN this country, because ILLEGALITY = CRIMINALITY!§All other parties are silent about the FIRST Islamic school in Flanders (in Genk) of the radical Islamic Turkish movement Milli Görüs. UNACCEPTABLE. Stop Islamic schools in our country!
