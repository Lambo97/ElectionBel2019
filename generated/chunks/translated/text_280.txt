These are images from last week of Brussels-North (passed on by a concerned citizen). For years ALL governing parties have ignored the problem of mass immigration and illegality. Time for a different policy, hard actions and real change. Time to CUSTOM! §We take the side of the population, of our people who have to make ends meet on a daily basis, where energy poverty has hit hard in recent years, who are paying blue in taxes,... Our vision is crystal clear: STOP the anti-social climate law of Green, NO new climate taxes!§No Theo Francken, this measure would only encourage new economic immigration and mass immigration. And we all know what disastrous consequences this has had on our country. STOP mass immigration!§ Incredible! FREE courses are offered by Minister Homans to foreigners with great pleasure. And how much does one course cost in reality? €4,300 per person. While the Flemish government introduced many new taxes on the felling of the Fleming, our tax money is being wasted!§STOP the anti-social climate plan of Green! Kristof Calvo has no idea how hard people have to work to make ends meet, to even go on holiday once. We're going to pay our green taxes in blue! §The mileage tax will be a new hidden tax increase. We already pay +50% taxes on fuel, our tax burden is almost the highest in Europe, the electricity bill is quietly becoming unaffordable,.... Stop squeezing out the population! §Islamism has no place in our country! LIKE if you agree.§No sp.a, you stay away from our savings. The people don't want another empty box of Johan Vande Lanotte. Stop this climate hysteria!§It's not left or right to demand REAL justice. It's not left or right to attack and rape HARD. This must be a top priority for everyone, because no victim should be abandoned by a failing justice system and an incompetent minister. Time for real change!
