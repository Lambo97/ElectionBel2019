In recent years, the so-called 'equal opportunities centre' Unia MILJOENEN received euros in subsidies from tough talkers Liesbeth Homans and Zuhal Demir (competent minister/ state secretary). Our position is crystal clear: turn on the subsidy tap, wipe up Unia and invest this money in OUR people!§Unbelievable! One year for such a horrible crime in Wevelgem, but according to competent minister Koen Geens nothing is wrong. Justice MUST be reformed. HARD sentences for crimes of morality, because justice must become just again!§Animal welfare is important to us. One of our points of view is to track down and tackle illegal animal trafficking via the internet. STOP the criminal gangs that earn billions of euros on the hijacking of (exotic) animals!§nan§Our nurses deserve more support! LIKE if you agree.§Please ask Tom Van Grieken directly!  More info: https://www.facebook.com/events/2324229941131456/§Thursday you can ask a question to Tom Van Grieken!§From 2020, Ghent will also introduce an LEZ. This hypocritical measure is a flat tax, because for € 345 per year we can continue to "pollute" with our older diesel. In the LEZ of Bart De Wever in Antwerp this even amounts to € 360 per year. Who is ultimately the victim of this? The ordinary citizen who cannot afford a new car. STOP the LEZ in our country!§STOP the LEZ in our country! We are the only party that wants to abolish this hypocritical measure. After all, who will be the victim of the "Low Emission Zone"? The ordinary citizen who can't afford a new car. STOP the climate madness!§Who still believes those people? The tax burden hasn't fallen, the budget deficit is running into billions, energy poverty is rising terribly, and on top of that - thanks to them - you can work for another two years... Time for real change, time to put our people first! Living wages for refugees?  ▶️ 2013: 69 million euros ▶️ 2018: 259 million euros Was this the power of change? We need to STOP with the OCMW of all the world!§STOP the LEZ in our country! We are the only party that wants to abolish this hypocritical measure. After all, who will be the victim of the "Low Emission Zone"? The ordinary citizen who can't afford a new car. STOP the climate madness! §STOP the LEZ in our country!

STOP the climate madness!§Some people last? What are Maggie De Block's priorities? 15,069 Flemish people do not receive the appropriate care because "there is not enough money". But it is possible to open a new asylum centre in Deurne. Time to put our people FIRST! No bus stops, no separate rooms, no tolerance,... There is only one solution to really clean up Brussels North: pick up illegal immigrants, lock them up and get them out of the country!  (Spread out if you agree)§Toddlers with a headscarf => problematic Toddlers with a headscarf as a sign => foreign to the world!  Thanks to VLD, N-VA and sp.a.§No Ben Weyts, the population did NOT want a flat tax increase. The hardworking citizen already pays blue to taxes on fuel (+/- 60% on petrol/diesel), wages, energy,... YOUR mileage tax is NEVER allowed. Not even after the elections.§ Every time again, the government parties make the wrong decisions. We have to catch these illegal immigrants, lock them up and get them out of the country! That's the only solution that will work. Time to clean up this country! Help us become the biggest!
