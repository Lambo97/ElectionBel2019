We continue to oppose the asylum centre in Dormaal! Come to our information evening and learn more about the fight against this centre.§It's Unavoidable that the Fleming is once again allowed to grovel in his portfolio, while the free policy for immigrants remains largely intact. For example, the abolition of the housing bonus is simply a disguised TAXATION! §The working conditions of the guards are a downright disgrace. That's why we continue to strive to offer solutions to their justified complaints!§WAANZIN! Maggie De Block will receive additional money for the reception of asylum seekers. Once again millions of taxpayers' money will be wasted, while our people will be left in the lurch. This is unacceptable. The early release of Michel Lelièvre, accomplice of child murderer Marc Dutroux, is a pure INDEPENDENT and proves once again how ROT justice is. Whoever is punished must serve his sentence! That's common sense, isn't it? Give young families the chance to buy a house. Don't abolish the housing bonus! LIKE if you agree.§The abolishment of the housing bonus is a disguised TAX! LIKE if you agree.§Who has NOT contributed to our social security, may NEVER benefit from our system. Surely that's common sense?§Is this the policy of Jan Jambon's government? Any more political appointments? What a shame. The people have had their fill of this kind of backroom politics. Appointments may be made ONLY on the basis of CONFIDENTIALITY and NOT on the basis of political affiliations! §Criminals must serve their full sentence! LIKE if you agree.§rapists and murderers may NEVER be released early! LIKE if you agree.§STOP squeezing out the population and reduce VAT on energy to 6%! LIKE if you agree.§The first corpses of the Jambon government are already falling out of the closet. The COST PRICE of abolishing the housing bonus becomes DESASTRY. An average house will cost a family €37,000 extra, for a single this is €17,000 extra. We need to save on immigration and the political system, NOT on the population! §Michelle Martin is already free. Yesterday Michel Lelièvre got his early release and now child murderer Marc DUTROUX is trying to get free himself. October 17, his application is ready. This MONSTER must NEVER be released: don't forget, don't forgive! PART if you agree.§Dutroux may NEVER be released! LIKE if you agree.§Firstly proclaiming that you are leaving UNIA and then starting a NEW and "Flemish" UNIA with our tax money, is not what the people want. What a deception on the part of the N-VA and Bart De Wever!§ Millions of euros of taxpayers' money are wasted on all kinds of ethnocultural non-profit organisations every year. AFSCHAFFEN! LIKE if you agree.§Who has contributed nothing to OUR social security should NEVER benefit from our system. LIKE if you agree!§Is this the will of the voter? Time to restore our democracy! LIKE if you agree.
