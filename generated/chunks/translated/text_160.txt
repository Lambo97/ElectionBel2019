The Open Vld and Gwendolyn Rutten have completely lost their pedals. Our party is out of the question, but with the (extreme) left they do bake sweet rolls.

(Be sure to keep an eye on our website, because other vacancies will be published in the coming weeks.)§On just one day, more than 18,000 applications came in for a free lion's flag. Would you like another one? Request it via www.leeuwenvlag.vlaanderen!§Today July 11th. Our holiday.  Defend our colours and hang out the Flemish Lion!  Request your free flag via http://leeuwenvlag.vlaanderen/§The federal parliament is installed and negotiations (where our party is excluded by the informers) continue. We will keep up the pressure. For example, it's time that every party confesses its colours on sex crimes. Rapeers and paedophiles must be punished HARD. STOP the low penalties and put the victims first. It's time for justice to be restored! §Who pays sky-high taxes and has therefore contributed to our social security, deserves a decent pension. That's not left or right but a matter of justice. However, our party is excluded at federal level where this issue is addressed. The current electricity bill is unacceptable and contributes to the harsh reality of energy poverty. Keep up the pressure on the federal negotiations - where our party is excluded and this issue is being decided - and spread the word! Join and build our party.
