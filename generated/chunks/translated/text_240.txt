Karel De Gucht (Open VLD) once called our voters dung beetles. Karel De Gucht (Open VLD) was today convicted of evading taxes.§ It is one year since Theo Francken, Jan Jambon and Didier Reynders went to Marrakech to sign the so-called 'Declaration of Marrakech' on behalf of the Belgian government. This text advocates "encouraging and strengthening the paths to regular migration". At that time Francken also quietly cooperated with the UN Migration Pact, also known as the Marrakech Pact. The N-VA's tough talk and election pledges are in stark contrast to the lax policy Francken actually pursued. In barely four years time, 500,000 new foreigners entered the country. Checking in at the polling booth on 26 May!§Protect our people. Today Vlaams Belang is the only straightforward and social party.§HALLUCINANTE images today from Schaerbeek. This aggression after false accusations is unacceptable. And what does the mayor do? Closing the school for a week... These rioters must not escape punishment!  (Spread this footage, because this must not be put under the mat.) §What is it Theo Francken? It's not that hard, is it? It's about protecting our borders, our social security, freedom of the press, our population... The Marrakech Pact MUST be a BREEKPUNT!§ Isn't it clear to everyone by now? Immigration is NO enrichment for our society, creates profit with our tax money and puts our social security under pressure!  (source: The Seventh Day)§Yesterday evening in Limburg. Again in Heers. This kind of anti-social immigrant wedding procession is a plague for this municipality and our country. Again and again they violate our (traffic) laws and cause inconvenience. Spread these images so that this ASOCIAL behaviour will not be covered up! §Merksem (Bouckenborghpark), 27 April. These riots with "young people" are silenced by the media. This criminal behaviour does NOT belong in our society. Spread these images, because this should not be covered up!§Stop mass importing violence and backwardness. The multicultural society fails on a micro level (asylum centres), why should it work on a macro level (society)? IMMIGRATIONSTOP NOW!§Large election meeting in Ninove!§According to a survey, 6 out of 10 Flemish people still have doubts about who they will give their vote to. So, we still have 4 weeks to campaign hard and convince people. On to victory. On to May 26th! #FirstOur people #Flemish-HANDY! Whoever commits such crimes (this time in Erpe-Mere) is never allowed to roam freely in our streets. Is it any wonder then that the population feels impunity? Is it bizarre that the public loses confidence in the government and justice? Time for real change! "All those asylum seekers are going to pay our pensions", doesn't NOT believe that? Stop lying to the people. Mass immigration is NOT an enrichment for our society! Did you know that Open Vld has been in the federal government for 20 years? This anti-social liberal party raised taxes on energy and fuel, increased the retirement age by two years and opened the immigration gates wide. Stop squeezing out the population and saddling them with an immigration bill that NIEMAND asked for! §"Even under Theo Francken, our country remained a top destination for OCMW tourists from all over the world. A stricter immigration policy is necessary and possible" - Dries Van Langenhove§What a KIEZERSBEDROG. First pretending, but after the elections Jinnih Beels adored the seat. Can anyone count Bart De Wever's number of bends? One thing is becoming more and more clear: a vote for N-VA, is a vote for sp.a!§What a flip-flop for the posts! A vote for the N-VA is - just like in Antwerp and many other municipalities - a vote for the left. Time to give a strong signal and punish these games on May 26th! §This was the Family Day in Bokrijk. Our 3,000 participants show that we have started a movement. On the 26th of May we are going for a Flanders in which our people come first again!§ONAVAILABLE! A total of € 749 million was spent on these living wages under Jan Jambon and Charles MICHEL. Was this the power of change? STOP with our social security, STOP with the OCMW of playing all over the world!
