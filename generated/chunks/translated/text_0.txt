Time for real change. Also in Geraardsbergen. Come to our opening meeting with Dries Van Langenhove and Guy D'Haeseleer on the 9th of February!§ Despite earlier promises not to save money, Wouter Beke now cuts the money for prevention in medicine. Don't save on the health of the hardworking Fleming but on immigration and the TORENHOGE transfers to Wallonia!§ While cleaning helpers strike for 1% wage surcharge - which they don't get - minister François Bellot wants a salary increase for top managers of public companies with 70%. The population should be the top priority, not the bank accounts of CEOs!§HALLUCINANT. A family that stayed ILLEGAL in the country received € 91,309 in "overdue" children's money. UNACCEPTABLE. What a slap in the face for everyone who works hard day in and day out and does contribute to our social security!§ Has anyone asked the Koksijden people if they want an asylum centre? Give the locals a real say at last. Let your voice be heard and come to our protest action on Monday 20 January!§ Has anyone asked the locals whether they want an asylum centre? Let your voice be heard and come to our protest action in Koksijde on Monday 20 January! § While the savings continue to increase, for 3 out of 4 of OUR elderly people their pension will not suffice to pay the bill for their retirement home. Therefore, save on immigration, the political system, the grazing stations,... and use this money to introduce a maximum bill for retirement homes. Choose the right priorities, time for EIGHTY change! The hardworking Fleming has to save more and more, but the budget for asylum continues to rise. € 800 MILLION goes annually to the shelter, the child allowance and the living wage of asylum seekers. Unacceptable. Save on asylum, not on OUR people!§Time to clean up Brussels and tackle the scum of the riots on New Year's Eve! LIKE if you agree.§The system of "retroactive" children's money is a pure INDEPENDENT. And it doesn't matter if it's $100 or $10,000. Anyone who has NOT contributed to our society and our social security should NEVER benefit from it. That is a matter of common sense! Feel free to agree.§Who has NOT contributed to our social security, should NEVER profit from this! Let your voice be heard on our protest action on MONDAY 30 DECEMBER at 19:15 at the town hall of Bekkevoort!§No asylum centre in Koksijde. Not now, NEVER! LIKE if you agree.§ Has anyone asked the Bekkevoordenaren if they want an asylum centre? Time for real participation! LIKE if you agree.§ Those who lose the elections become ministers. And those who win the elections will be on the opposition benches. So who feeds the anti-politics? Who's ignoring the voter's signal in this way? §NONE. You hear right. According to Karel De Gucht of Open Vld, you, the voter, are the problem. Open Vld has been in the federal government for 20 years and what's her legacy? Open borders, rising taxes, a failing justice system, a higher retirement age... The voter isn't the problem, but those unworldly liberals and their anti-social policies! § The low-emission zone is a HYPOCRIETE and ASOCIAL measure. Whoever pays the "toll" is allowed to keep driving. In this way, Ghent has already collected hundreds of thousands of euros. The LEZ is a PLATT tax on the hood of those who are already having a hard time. Because who is the victim? The hardworking Fleming who can't afford a new car. Away with the LEZ!§ The Hasselt government wants to introduce an LEZ. Who's going to get screwed? The ordinary citizen who can't afford a new car. 👍 = once!§Who will be the victim of an LEZ in Hasselt? The hardworking Hasselt citizen who can't afford a new car. NO LEZ in Hasselt! 👍 = once
