LIKE if you agree.§Who has contributed nothing to our social security, should never immediately benefit from our system. Isn't that common sense? Billions of euros are wasted every year on an ever-increasing immigration bill, while our people are left out in the cold. We are NOT the OCMW of the whole world!§The population wants real change, not a coalition of the losers!§The population wants real change, not a coalition of the losers!§LIKE if you agree.§No socialists in power in Flanders! LIKE if you agree.§Real change or another five years more of the same? We choose the side of the population that has had enough of mass immigration, plague taxes, a failing justice system, grazing stations, unlivable pensions,... For what do you choose, Bart De Wever?§Who has contributed nothing to OUR social security, may NOT benefit more from our system. We have to stop benefit migration. That's a step towards real change and yet logic itself? Away with a coalition of the losers, because nobody wants the same non-policy back! §Who has contributed nothing to OUR social security, should NOT profit more from our system.

We choose the side of the population that has had enough of mass immigration, plague taxes, a failing justice system, grazing stations, unlivable pensions,... What do you choose, Bart De Wever? To put OUR people back in first place. That's what we want to achieve. EIGHT CHANGE, that's what the people want. It's time to stop mass immigration, tackle impunity, give priority to a liveable pension, lighten the energy bill... It's time for the other parties to show their colours: five years of the same or make this country liveable again! § What is the legacy of the Open Vld after 20 years of federal government? The borders are wide open, the tax burden is immense, justice is still messy, sex crimes are hardly punished, the retirement age has been raised to 67 years, the energy bill has been derailed,... Away with these unworldly liberals and their anti-social policies! Scandalous! Pool terror is ignored and not taken seriously. The boerkini, a symbol of inequality between men and women, is admitted. And anyone protesting against this? He'll be PACKed. What a upside-down world.§In this country we have politicians who derail the budget with MILLION Euros, but maximize their own personal finances and greedily look up the corresponding items. Away with this grazing policy, time for real change and a policy for the benefit of OUR people.§ Incredible and yet the traditional parties want to repatriate IS-terrorists/women to our country. For us it is crystal clear: whoever left for Syria to support the barbaric IS regime, does NOT belong in our country anymore!  (Source: VRT NWS)§Our first vacancies are online!
