# ElectionBel2019

In this repository I analyse the ads published on facebook by Belgium political partis in 2019. This analyse is decomposed in 4 notebooks (src section) corresponding to the 4 steps of the project.

## Data collection

The data are scrapped from the facebook ad library

## Data cleaning

Merge data from each parti and clean data

## Number data analysis

In this notebook I use only number data to answer these research questions :

* What is the evolution of the number of ads by parti ?
* Is there any difference between north and south in the use of facebook ads ?
* Is the number of likes of budget allocated to ads related to the number of seats or delta ?
* What is the strategy of the different partis concerning ads on social media

## Textual Data analysis

Here I used the textual data from the ads to answer these reasearch questions :

* What are the main topic of the ads
* Whats is the favorite topic of each parti
* What are the global sentiment in these ads


## To Do:
* Textual data analysis
* Website for visalization
* Iterate through the project by collecting more data
